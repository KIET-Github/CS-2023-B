# Real-time Attentiveness Detection System 
The project includes a system consisting of different modules to check
attentiveness of people and notify them about it. It is often found that attendees in
online meeting become inattentive once they join it. The list would be visible
showing the attentiveness according to the considered parameters of meeting
attendees. A buzzer system is introduced which will alert the attendee also about
the inattentiveness.
