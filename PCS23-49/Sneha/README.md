# Introduction

Planner is a full stack web application built using MERN stack to keep a track of your activity. You can track it for every month, day, or even an hour.

-   **Runtime used for whole application** - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   **Frontend framework** - [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
-   **CSS preprocessor** - [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
-   **Backend framework** - [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
-   **Database** - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

# Navigation

-   **Home Page** - Planner's Home page contains links for different pages of the web app.

-   **Calendar** - Planner contains a calendar which helps us visualize the days of any month of any year, withour any year limit. Unlike other calendars, our Planner works on an algorithm.

# Themes

Planner's color palette has been synchronized and carefully chosen to provide the best user experience.

The app will switch to dark mode automatically after 8:00 PM and will switch back to light mode at 8:00 AM.

Nevertheless, the user could override this option by switching between different modes as per their convenience.

To switch between different modes, click on theme icon in the header.

-   **Light Mode**

# Local Development

- Install all the dependencies
```sh
npm i
```

- Run the project in development mode

```sh
npm run react
```

- Run the backend server

```sh
npm run server
```
This will run the server on port [$PORT](http://localhost:5000) locally with nodemon to continuously watch every change.

- If you don't have nodemon on your system, run
```sh
npm i nodemon -g
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) to view it in the browser.
