# Real-time Attentiveness Detection System 
There had been a lot of technological shifts going on, but this was boosted due to pandemic. 
During the pandemic a new trend started where students and employees would attend classes 
and meetings remotely. This complete shift to online mode led to more instances where the 
meeting attendees showed signs of inattentiveness, like sleepiness, distraction, drowsiness, 
not being present in front of the camera. This further led to decrease in productivity and 
efficiency. Among the various surveys done, one of the surveys showed that the instances of 
inattentiveness increased, and people tend to indulge in off-task activities at some point 
during the meetings or classes. Due to such rising problems, we proposed this model which 
will identify inattentive behaviour of the attendee based on eye closure and yawning 
detection. The model is designed in such a way that it will automatically detect 
inattentiveness of the person and will trigger an alarm at the attendeeâ€™s end. 
The model will classify the states of the attendee as- Active, Sleeping and Drowsy. 
According to the state of the attendee their attentiveness will be judged, and the alarm will be 
triggered in inattentive states (i.e., drowsy, and sleepy). The attendance will be then marked 
on the basis of final score.
